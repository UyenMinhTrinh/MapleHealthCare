        <p class="lead">
          Ha began her career as a medical doctor in Vietnam, where she developed a deep passion for patient care and
          community health. Seeking new opportunities to grow and contribute, she immigrated to Vancouver, Canada in 2010.
          After re-establishing her career in a new country, she dedicated herself to nursing, working for many years as
          a frontline registered nurse in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Her compassion for patients and her
          strong leadership skills soon led her to become the leader of nursing care in both long-term care and retirement
          homes in Vancouver and Victoria, BC.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Throughout this time, Ha continued to advance her education and professional development. She earned a certificate
          in gerontological nursing (RN/NP), gaining specialized knowledge in caring for seniors and individuals with complex
          medical needs. Her hands-on experience, combined with her advanced training, has allowed her to provide a high
          standard of care for patients facing a wide range of health challenges.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          In 2022, Ha relocated to Ottawa, Ontario with her family. Motivated by her personal values and a strong commitment
          to supporting the local community, she founded Maple Health Care to bring compassionate, professional in-home care
          to families in Ottawa. Through Maple Health Care, Ha continues her mission to help people remain safe, comfortable,
          and independent in their own homes, while giving families peace of mind that their loved ones are in trusted hands.
