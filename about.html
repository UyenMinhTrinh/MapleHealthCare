          Ha began her career as a medical doctor in Vietnam, where she developed a deep passion for patient care and
          community health. Seeking new opportunities to grow and contribute, she immigrated to Vancouver, Canada in 2010.
          After re-establishing her career in a new country, she dedicated herself to nursing, working for many years as
          a frontline registered nurse in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Her compassion for patients and her
          strong leadership skills soon led her to become the leader of nursing care in both long-term care and retirement
          homes in Vancouver and Victoria, BC.

          in gerontological nursing (RN/NP), gaining specialized knowledge in caring for seniors and individuals with complex
          medical needs. Her hands-on experience, combined with her advanced training, has allowed her to provide a high
          standard of care for patients facing a wide range of health challenges.

          and independent in their own homes, while giving families peace of mind that their loved ones are in trusted hands.
