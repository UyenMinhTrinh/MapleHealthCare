      <p>We can provide a Homemaker, Companion, Nurse’s Aide, or professional Nurse for complex care or hospice services. Whatever your situation, we can meet all of your healthcare needs.</p>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Free Home Assessment by a Registered Nurse, GNC(C)</h4>
      <p>Our goal is to match the ideal caregiver to your unique needs. We prefer to meet with the client and their family before beginning services to assess requirements and personal preferences. This helps us ensure the most important part of homecare: <strong>Consistency of Care</strong>.</p>

      <p>We conduct a full assessment with the Nursing Supervisor, reviewing medical history and desired outcomes to craft a personalized Care Plan. We also consider cultural preferences, dietary needs, language, transportation availability, and scheduling when selecting the caregiver.</p>

      <p>We assist in arranging necessary medical equipment at home, such as handrails, commodes, or mobility aids, to ensure comfort and safety.</p>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Change in Care</h4>
      <p>Care needs can evolve. We’re flexible and ready to adjust caregiver hours or services as needed. If residential care becomes necessary, we can continue support through Added Care and private companionship services.</p>

      <p>Even if you decide not to hire Maple after your assessment, we’re still happy to help you navigate your options and advocate for your wellbeing.</p>
